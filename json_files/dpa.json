If subprocessing occurs with consent, it must be via a written agreement imposing the same obligations on the subprocessor as on the data importer. The data importer remains fully liable for the subprocessor's performance. 2. The written contract between data importer and subprocessor must include a third-party beneficiary clause (Clause 3) for data subjects unable to claim compensation from the data exporter or data importer due to their disappearance, cessation, or insolvency, unless a successor entity has assumed obligations. Subprocessor liability is limited to its own processing. 3. Data protection aspects of subprocessing contracts are governed by the law of the Member State where the data exporter is established. 4. The data exporter must maintain an annually updated list of subprocessing agreements, notified by the data importer (Clause 5(j)), which is available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority."

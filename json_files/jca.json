For high-risk processing, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) will be performed and incorporated into a Schedule. Each Party is responsible for recording data processing activities in a register. These obligations extend to those processing data under the Parties' authority (Employees, Data Processors). Parties must clearly communicate to Data Subjects where to exercise their rights, as per Schedule 2. Schedule 1 will detail the Collaborative Partnership, including its purpose, nature, applications, and suppliers. Schedule 2 will specify mutual responsibilities, including who concludes Data Processing Agreements, implements technical/organizational measures, and enables Data Subjects' rights. Appendix 3 will detail the Data Processing Operations' nature, purposes, types of Data Subjects, Personal Data, retention periods, Employee access, Data Processors, cross-EEA data transmission, and Data Breach contact details.
